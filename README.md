### We Believe One Missing Child Is One Too Many :family:
Nearly 800,000 missing children reports are registered worldwide every year. This is sadly only a fraction of the actual number of children who go missing or are found lost across the globe. Although these cases are reported to the police, in countries like India, often it is found that they are not given the attention they urgently need. Our inspiration behind this project was to help in this situation by providing a platform where urgent information regarding a missing child or a lost child found somewhere can be spread across social media quickly and widely so that it can be brought to everyone's attention as soon as possible.

### What ReuniteBot Does :dart:
The ReuniteBot is a twitter bot that:
1) Likes and retweets the posts across twitter with hashtags related to missing and lost children.
2) Tags and mentions important authorities to grab urgent attention and receive help.
3) Uses location of the original post to determine which authorities to contact. We have tried contacting NGOs for shelter for lost children without families and the police authorities and government for missing children.
4) Removes irrelavent and unnecessary posts that aren't related to missing or lost children but have these hashtags.
5) Uses NLP to classify posts into three categories: 1) Missing Children 2) Lost Children 3) Unrelated
